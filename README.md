Aarogya Bharat: Blockchain-Based Medical History Management
Aarogya Bharat utilizes Tezos blockchain technology to securely store and manage patients' medical histories in the cloud. This cutting-edge project aims to revolutionize medical record-keeping with enhanced security and efficiency through blockchain's immutable and decentralized features.

Key Components:

Hospital Application: Hospitals can register and onboard their medical staff onto the framework. They gain access to patient medical histories only after obtaining explicit consent from the patient, ensuring that sensitive information is shared securely and responsibly.

Patient Application: Patients can easily view their medical reports, including diagnoses and lab results, from any location. Aarogya Bharat eliminates the need for physical medical records, allowing patients to access their medical history seamlessly when visiting any hospital.

By integrating Tezos blockchain, Aarogya Bharat offers a secure, tamper-proof solution for managing medical information, ensuring that patient data is protected and accessible only to authorized individuals.
